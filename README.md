# Discriminalizer

.NET library designed for seamless JSON deserialization of complex object hierarchies, built on top of System.Text.Json.

## Motivation

Modern software development often involves dealing with diverse and complex data structures, particularly when working
with APIs or external data sources. JSON deserialization is a critical aspect of such scenarios, and traditional
approaches can become cumbersome, especially when handling polymorphic structures.
This project was born out of the need for a streamlined and flexible solution for
JSON deserialization within the .NET ecosystem. We recognized the challenges developers face when working with
polymorphic object hierarchies and aimed to simplify this process.
By leveraging the discriminator configuration approach and integrating with System.Text.Json, this library empowers
developers to handle intricate JSON structures effortlessly. Whether you are working on a web application, API
integration, or any project requiring efficient object deserialization, the library provides a
robust toolset to enhance your development experience.
We believe in fostering collaboration and welcome contributions from the community to make this library even more
versatile and effective. Join us in simplifying JSON deserialization in .NET, and let's build better software together!
